ğŸŒ¾ KrishiMitram â€“ SIH 2025
ğŸ‘‹ Welcome Team ğŸš€

This repository contains the base folder structure for our project KrishiMitram, our SIH 2025 solution.

ğŸ‘‰ Important:
This is a dummy/starting folder structure created to give us a clean foundation.

Team members can customize, add, or reorganize files/folders as per their use case.

The structure is here to ensure we all have a common starting point and avoid confusion later.

As we progress, we will refine it together to match our actual implementation.
